# Contributing
I welcome contributions and suggestions for EmergentMUD! If you would like to contribute to the project, here are some basic guidelines.

## Check for existing planned work

Check the open GitHub issues to see if what you want to do is there already. If it isn't, check the [Roadmap](https://github.com/scionaltera/emergentmud/wiki/Product-Roadmap) to see if it's something that work has already been planned for.

I strongly recommend discussing your proposed changes by opening an issue before doing work on it, just to avoid duplicated and wasted effort. I can either assign a ticket to you or we can create a new ticket as necessary. If what you want to do isn't in line with the vision for EmergentMUD, you are still more than welcome to fork it and take it in your own direction.

## Code style

* Use a descriptive branch name. Name it after an issue, or describe the feature you're adding. For example: `improve-npc-pathfinding` or `fix-issue-93`.
* Please try to match the coding style (indentations, brackets, variable names, etc.) of existing code as best as possible.
* Make sure the code you are contributing is covered by unit tests, and that `./gradlew clean buildDocker` fully passes.
* Document your work, or include updates to the existing documentation as necessary.
* Include the license header in any new files that you create.

If you get stuck or have questions, go ahead and open the pull request. I'll be glad to discuss it with you and guide you through any revisions that might be necessary before it can be merged.

## Start small

If you have not contributed to EmergentMUD before, consider looking for an issue labeled `good first issue` for your first contribution. If there isn't one that you want to work on, consider proposing a new issue first. Doing so will help to plan the work you'd like to do and ensure that it's in line with EmergentMUD's direction before committing a lot of time and effort to it.

## Becoming a Collaborator

I am not seeking additional Collaborators at this time, but if the right person comes along I'll approach them about it. I expect this stance to change as the game becomes more playable and a community begins to form around EmergentMUD.
